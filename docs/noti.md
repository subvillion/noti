## Setting up cloud accounts

### BearyChat

Log into your BearyChat account. Then create an [incoming robot][bc-incoming].
Next, look for the "Hook Address" (or "Hook 地址" in Chinese), this is what
you'll set `bearychat.incomingHookURI` to.

### Keybase

Log into your [Keybase] account and go to the Chat section.
Pick a team or user to send to, and set your `keybase.conversation` to that
name. For teams, you can also specify a channel with `keybase.channel` or have
it send to `general`. You can also send notifications that auto-delete with
`keybase.explodingLifetime` set between `30s` (seconds) to `168h` (hours).

As long as the keybase service is running and the `keybase` binary is in your
system path, you should be all set.

### Pushbullet

Log into your Pushbullet account. Next, click on [Settings] on the left sidebar.
Scroll down to "Access Tokens" and click "Create Access Token". The text that
appears will be what you'll set `pushbullet.accessToken` to.

### Pushover

Log into your [Pushover] account. Next, look for the "User Key". That's what
you'll set `pushover.userKey` to.

Next [create a new application]. Fill in the fields. Under "Type", select
"Script". Finally, go to the application page. Look for "API Token/Key". This is
what you'll set `pushover.apiToken` to.

### Pushsafer

Log into your [Pushsafer] account. Next, look for the "Private or Alias Key".
That's what you'll set `pushsafer.key` to.

### Simplepush

Install the Simplepush Android app to get your Simplepush key.
That's the key you'll set to `simplepush.key`.
Simplepush requires no registration and sending notifications is completely free.

In the app you can create events to customize ringtone and vibration patterns for
different kinds of notifications.
The event id you can set in the app, translates to `simplepush.event` in noti.

Development] page. Create a token. This is what you'll set `slack.token` to.

The variable `slack.channel` can be set to a channel like `#general` or
`#random`. You can also set it to someone's username, like `@jaime` or
`@variadico`.

### Telegram

Open your telegram app, and start a conversation with the [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather)
and use the `/newbot` to get the BotFather to create your bot and lastly copy and keep the bot token

### Twilio

Log into your [Twilio] account. Next go to the "Project info" tab. look for "ACCOUNT SID" that's what you will set for `twilio.accountsid` and look for "AUTH TOKEN" that's what you will set for `twilio.authtoken`
